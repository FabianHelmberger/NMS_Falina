This is the Protocol written by Fabian Helmberger and Selina Dirnboeck, Group 24 Team Tuesday.
In the following we will review our results for exercice from the 05.04.22

The goal was to solve the one-dimensional Poisson Equation (PE) on the unitary domain for a inhomogenity proportional to the cosine function.
This was done by discretizing the domain into N evenly spaced points and then using the Thomas Algorithm (TA) for the resulting system of
linear equations. In our implementation, we feed N to a python function, which runs the TA for the fixed boundry conditions on the edge of
the domain.

Further, the numerical results were compared to the analytic solution, which was obtained by seperating and integrating the PE.
A visual comparison was performed by plotting solutions for N = 10 and N = 100. (See Fig1)

The results of a accuracy and cpu-time analysis are shown in Fig2. We used the standard deviation as a measure of accuracy.
